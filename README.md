# FileZIP
Designed and built HTTP API to zip files (using Lempel-Ziv Markov Chain Lossless Compression Algorithm) with GET and POST requests for uploading, retrieving, zipping, and listing files. Used PyDrive, Google Drive API, and Python-Flask-RESTful backend; handled filename collisions.

All source code and updates available in "shree-progress" branch.
